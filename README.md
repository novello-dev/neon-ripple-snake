Neon-styled Snake prototype built while studying GitHub Copilot (GH-300 certification).  
Started as a basic workshop project and evolved into a sandbox for experimenting with AI-assisted development.

**⚠️ Learning project:** This project isn’t about the final result, it’s about learning how to use GitHub Copilot in a real environment and understanding where AI helps or hurts.
Huge parts are AI-assisted, the code is not production-ready, and the goal here is documentation and experimentation, not polish.

## 🤖 Copilot Notes

**What worked:**  
Rapid prototyping, boilerplate generation, autocomplete.

**What didn’t:**  
Loses context in long sessions, architecture still requires manual thought, generated code can get messy.

**My view:**  
Copilot is great for productivity helpers (autocomplete, docstrings, cleanup),  
but I don’t enjoy when it writes full logic for me.  
Still, since it’s widely used in the industry, this project helped me build an informed, hands-on opinion.

**Future use:**  
Autocomplete • Documentation • Small helpers.  
Not for architecture or core gameplay logic.
